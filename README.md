Hello! I'm Eduardo, a Master's in Finance Student at IE, with a Bachelors in Mathematics from the University of Edinburgh.

This is a small personal repo that I'm using to record my learning process with the coding side of quant finance, hence why some strategies on here will be trivially simple, and others more complex.

If you want to see specifics about each strategy, there are small writeups for each one.

Thank you for taking a look, I hope you find something interesting.
